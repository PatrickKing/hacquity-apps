  # TODO: I do not want a user destroy endpoint. Would prefer to remove it from the router, but devise only seems to support skipping entire chunks of functionality, e.g. all of registrations, and not individual routes within a module. You could skip registrations and manually specify all the routes you do want, but that seems error prone, so just going with this no-op function instead.
